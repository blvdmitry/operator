# Alert

<Featured>
  Alerts help users identify when something is wrong and provide context to fix
  the problem. An alert blocks the usage of the app/site until the user takes an
  action.

## Usage

Alerts are system messages that reflect system driven information to the users.
Alerts do not communicate changes in content, features, or availability.
Since they communicate important information, they are not dismissable by the user.
They are not notifications or banners

```jsx
import { Alert } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { AlertProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Use `variant` prop to provide emotional context for your Alert.

<Example name="variants" />

Alert can have more simplied appearnce when using `inline` prop.
Use `bleed` to completely remove paddings.

<Example name="layout" />

Create your own custom alert using a slot.

<Example name="composition" />

### Responsive Properties

`inline` property can be responsive. It means it can have different value between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).
