# AspectRatio

<Featured>
  Aspect ratio is a utility for media element's size proportions.
</Featured>

## Usage

```jsx
import { AspectRatio } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { AspectRatioProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

`AspectRatio` automatically works for the `<img>` tags passed to it.
Otherwise you can manually define the styles for your custom element.
For instance, if you want to render a `div` with a background image.

It supports multpiple ratio values, like `1:1` (default), `16:9` and `4:3`.

<Example name="sixteen-nine" />

Ratio and width properties can be responsive. That means they can have different values between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

## Accessibility

When rendering an image inside the `AspectRatio`, don't forget to pass an `alt` attribute to it or set its role to `presentation` if you don't have sufficient data to describe it.
