# Avatar

<Featured>
  Use avatars to represent an entity or a user's identity to associate them with
  personalised content and indicate content created by the user themselves.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Avatar } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { AvatarProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

The most basic presentation variant of an avatar will be an image.
Avatars can be presented using multiple provided sizes, with `medium` size used as a default value:

<Example name="size" />

Avatar component is integrated with the asset service, which means you can use it to display country flags by using `countryCode` property.
Note that flags are stored as pngs so currently it's possible to use it only with `small` avatar size.

<Example name="asset" />

In case image `url` is not available for an avatar, text or icon fallback can be applied instead:

<Example name="fallback" />

In case image url is a wrong image `url`, the text or the icon will be used as fallback:

<Example name="fallbackUrl" />

When image is not rendered, you can use any of the provided color schemes:

<Example name="color" />

For the cases where background is dynamic, you can use `inherit` color value.
For example, it should be helpful when rendering avatars on top of brand color, to keep them accessible no matter which theme is applied.

<Example name="colorInherit" />

If you need to visually highlight the avatar or separate it from the rest of the content, you can use `outline` property:

<Example name="outline" />

## Responsive properties

Size property can be responsive. That means it can have different value between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

## Accessibility

The avatar component represents content (an entity or a user's identity), and should have a text equivalent for people using assistive technologies (such as screen readers).

- When used on its own - make sure you pass `ariaLabel` to the component.
- When an avatar is adjacent to a text alternative, such as a user name, omit `ariaLabel`, so that they can be ignored by assistive technologies. Refer to Avatar block for this use case.
