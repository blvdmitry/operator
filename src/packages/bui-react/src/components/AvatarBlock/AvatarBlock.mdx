## Usage

```jsx
import { AvatarBlock } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { AvatarBlockProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

AvatarBlock comes in three sizes, with `medium` being a default one.
You can use change any of the `Avatar` properties in it except for its `size`, which is defined by the `size` of the AvatarBlock.

<Example name="default" />

When rendering AvatarBlock on top of background colors, use `inherit` color to make the text color dynamically adjust based on the parent color value.
For example, AvatarBlock rendered in the header can use the color defined by it.

<Example name="colorInherit" />

## Responsive properties

Size property can be responsive. That means it can have different value between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

## Accessibility

Avatar block represents content (an entity or a user's identity) adjacent to a text alternative, such as a user/entity name.
Avatar doesn't need to have an `ariaLabel` so that it can be ignored by assistive technologies; as it is redundant for the screen reader to read the name twice.
