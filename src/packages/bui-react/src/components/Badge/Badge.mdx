# Badge

<Featured>
  Badges highlight statuses or certain unique aspects of an item. In the case of
  a property, a badge can be used for highlighting Genius benefits. In the case
  of a booking, a badge can highlight the status, such as cancellations.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Badge } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { BadgeProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Badge supports a handful of variants you can use in the product based on their context with the `variant` property.

<Example name="variants" />

Each color can be used with an `alternative` flag to make the Badge look less prominent on the page and not visually conflict with regular badges.

<Example name="alternative" />

When badges are used on top of media content, it's recommended to use `media` variant of the badge to make them have enough contrast ratio.
In this case, `alternative` badge gets semi-transparent background.

<Example name="media" />

Badges can be dismissed with an `onClose` handler, which is useful when rendering them as tags for the form elements.
You should always be passing `closeAriaLabel` to have the close button appear.

<Example name="dismissible" />

### Icon Support

Badges can also have icons in them. When using badges with icons only, the `ariaLabel` prop is required.

<Example name="icon" />

## Accessibility

While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies will simply be presented with the content of the badge.
Depending on the specific situation, badges may seem like random additional words at the end of a sentence, link, or button.

Therefore:

- Unless the context is clear, include additional context with an `aria-label` attribute.
- Be sure the badge text is clear and concise.
- If the Badge contains only an Icon, the `ariaLabel` prop is required

Additionally:

- Do not use colour alone to convey meaning, nor as the sole means to differentiate badges, because it is not accessible.
- Do not use custom colours as the default colour palette is built to comply with WCAG AA minimum contrast requirements.
