## Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { ButtonProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

### Variants

Button supports multiple variants based on how prominent you want your action to be:
`primary` for the main action,
`secondary`, `secondary-neutral`, `tertiary` and `tertiary-neutral` for other actions based on the use case.

<Example name="variants" />

When you're using a Button on top of a background color, you can use `tertiary-inherit` variant, which will color the button based on the text color of the parent element. For instance, a `tertiary-inherit` Button used in the Header will be colored in white.

<Example name="tertiaryInherit" />

Button variant `white` is a neutral button that should be used on static content because it wonâ€™t change colours in dark mode. Main use case on campaign images or dark backgrounds.

<Example name="white" />

Button variant `elevated` is a neutral button that should be used on top of content and switches in dark mode. Contains a shadow to stand out from the background. Main use case is maps.

<Example name="elevated" />

### Color (destructive or action)

Whenever Button is triggerring a critical action, like deleting data, `destructive` flag should be used to change the button color.
It can be used together with `primary, secondary, tertiary` and `elevated` variants.

<Example name="destructive" />

### Icon

Button supports an additional icon display on either of its sides to help the user better understand the context.
Icon can be used with or without the button text.

<Example name="icon" />

### States

If user has to wait for an action to be completed, for instance if button starts a network request, you should switch its state to `loading`. Loading state will ignore all additional Button click events and will preserve the button width as it was in the original state.

<Example name="loading" />

When Button shouldn't be clicked, `disabled` flag should be applied.

<Example name="disabled" />

### Sizes

Depending on the purpose and context of the button, you may change its size to `large`. This is especially helpful for mobile layout and marketing pages.

<Example name="size" />

In addition to that, in mobile interfaces, you might want to make the Button take full width of its parent, which can be achieved with `wide` property.

<Example name="wide" />

### Responsive Properties

Size and wide properties can be responsive. That means they can have different values between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

### Alignment

In case you're using a tertiary button, its background is completely transparent by default, therefore it will be visually misaligned with the rest of the content.
To keep the button text aligned with the content, you can use `Button.Aligner` compound component.

<Example name="aligner" />

## Accessibility

- Button automatically resolves HTML tag based on the properties you pass to it. For example, if you pass `href` to it, it will automatically render an `<a>` tag.

- For buttons without text content, using the `aria-label` attribute is **mandatory** for accessibility, and always make sure content of this attribute describes what will happen when clicking the button:

```jsx
<Button icon={<Close />} attributes={{ aria-label: 'Close this banner' }} />
```

- When triggering action without reloading the page, the button should trigger a notification to screen reader users about the action taking place.

- Do not use a button to redirect to a new page outside the browsing/booking flow.
