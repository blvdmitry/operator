## Usage

```jsx
import { Card } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { CardProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Card is an empty container which can have any kind of layout inside.

<Example name="empty" />

You can apply elevation to a Card to create visual hierarchy and draw attention to elements that require the userâ€™s attention.

<Example name="elevated" />

### Composition

You can use it to visually group the content together with layout utilities like Stack to display its `children`.
For example, you can achieve the following layout by just combining utilities provided by the library.

<Example name="composition" />

Following the same approach, you can achieve more complicated layouts.
For example, you can display an image on the leading side of the Card using an `Image` utility.

<Example name="media" />

If you need to display some content inside the Card that goes from side to side, you can remove the padding with the `fill` flag and use it together with the `Box` utility

<Example name="fill" />

### Variant

Use different variants to give your Card proper styling.

<Example name="variants" />

### Responsive

For mobile viewports, Card supports `bleed` property that will apply negative horizontal margins to make it take full-page width on mobile viewport only.
This negative margin is aligned with `Container` padding values.

<Example name="bleed" />

## Accessibility

- If you want to make Card to be used for navigation, make sure to wrap it with `Actionable` utility and not pass `href` or `onClick` to card through attributes
- When an image is present, always add an alt attribute with the image description
