## Usage

```jsx
import { Chip } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { ChipProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Chip component combines two variants with different behavior: "toggle" and "action".

- <a href="#Variant-Toggle">**Toggle**</a> is a customised version of a checkbox
  element that can be grouped together to do multi-selection.

- <a href="#Variant-Action">**Action variant**</a> is basically a button that can
  act as a trigger for a dropdown or sheet container and helps to reflect a certain
  selection state with a bubble (for example number of selected filters).

### Variant Toggle

Since it's an input, it requires a `name` to be passed to it.
Everytime user toggles it, an `onChange` handler is called where you can add custom business logic.

<Example name="default" />

Additionally, it can be used as a list of dismissible tags.
With `dismissible` flag it will always be highlighted and a dismiss icon will appear.
`onChange` in this case can be used to remove the component from the page.

<Example name="dismissible" />

**Controlled and uncontrolled**

All input components in BUI support controlled and uncontrolled version.
Uncontrolled version is the default behavior where you can check it by default with `defaultChecked` flag but the browser will control the rendering of the input.

Controlled version is enabled once you pass `checked` flag.
This means that toggling the component will only trigger `onChange` but you will have to update the `checked` value using your own state.

<Example name="controlledAndUncontrolled" />

For managing state of multiple `Chip` components â€” use `InputCheckboxGroup`.

### Variant Action

Chip with `variant=action` variant does not require `name` or `value`. Use `selected` prop to control whether Chip is selected.
An arrow-icon is always displayed.

<Example name="variantAction" />

Display the amount of selected options with `bubble` prop. Make sure to provide ARIA label via `bubble.ariaLabel`.
Bubble is displayed only when `selected` is true.

<Example name="variantActionBubble" />

### Common Props and Composition

Both variants of Chip can be `disabled` which will prevent any user interaction with it.

<Example name="disabled" />

When used over media content, you should be using `elevated` check buttons.
For instance, this helps when rendering check buttons on top of a map or an image.

<Example name="elevated" />

To help user understand the role of each button, you can add an icon in addition to the label.

<Example name="icon" />

Most of the time you would use multiple of them together.
The easiest way to render them next to each other is by using `Stack` utility.
However, you will need to handle their state on the product side.

<Example name="group" />

If you want to group them side by side and keep them in their container you can benefit from the `shrink` property of the `Stack.Item` component.

<Example name="multiline" />

In cases where you need to horizontally scroll all the chips, you can use `wrap` property of the `Stack` component.

<Example name="horizontalScroll" />

## Accessibility

- When using a group of check buttons, make sure there is a label explaining what this group is responsible for.
- When using `action` variant and `bubble` prop, make sure to provide ARIA label via `bubble.ariaLabel`.
