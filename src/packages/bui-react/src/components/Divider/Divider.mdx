### Usage

```jsx
import { Divider } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { DividerProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Dividers can be used to separate content horizontally and vertically.

<Example name="horizontal" />

Vertical dividers take the full-height of its parent.

<Example name="vertical" />

### Responsive Properties

Vertical property can be responsive. That means it can have different value between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

### Accessibility

Use HTML header elements (H1-H6) to identify new sections. These may be complemented by visual or other cues such as dividers / horizontal rules, but should not be replaced by them.
