# FormControl

<Featured>
  FormControl is a utility for rendering elements that are usually displayed for
  form fields, like labels, error messages etc.

## Usage

```jsx
import { FormControl } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { FormControlProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Since we're using the same styles for our form elements, we're using this utility internally in core BUI components.
However, it's also valuable to use it in custom product patterns to avoid reimplementing the same thing from scratch.

FormControl doesn't apply its styles to the children. For example, if you pass `disabled` property, its label colors will be updated but input should receive disabled property separately.

It works with `children` function to generate ids for the form field to make it accessible out of the box.
It returns an object with html attributes that you should just pass to your input element or component.

**Note**: BUI inputs already use FormControl internally, so you don't have to wrap them with this utility manually.

Give users instructions or additional information about the field using `helper` prop.

<Example name="helper" />

Communicate validation errors and other problems using `error` prop.

<Example name="error" />

Mark users successful actions with `success` prop. For example, two password fields matching.

<Example name="success" />

Use `disabled` prop to reflect disabled state of the input.

<Example name="disabled" />

Build even more descriptive forms with other props: `subLabel`, `labelEndSlot` etc.

<Example name="other" />
