# Grid

<Featured>
  Grid is a utility for rendering content in grid-like layouts.
</Featured>

## Usage

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { GridProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Grid utility is build on top of CSS Flexbox, so its API should feel familiar.
It uses 12-column system and is usually composed of `<Grid>` and `<Grid.Column>` components.

Consider this example with column `size=3` and `offset=3` for the last column.

<Example name="default" />

Have smaller gutter with `size=small`. Remove default column paddings using `bleed` prop.

<Example name="smallBleed" />

Multiline grids are no problem.

<Example name="multiline" />

Grid has various align and justify options.

<Example name="alignJustify" />

### Responsive Properties

Grid properties like `gap`, `align`, `justify` or Grid.Column's `size`, `offset` can be responsive. That means they can have different values between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

The following example shows the advantages of responsive `gap` together with `reversed`. Try changing the breakpoint from desktop to mobile:

<Example name="responsive" />

### Utility Layer

Quite often you find yourself in need for some basic CSS styling. Grid as well as other BUI Components has support for stylying via [BUI Utility Layer](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#BUI-Utility-Layer).

<Example name="utilityLayer" />

Try switching between breakpoints to see the padding applied and toggle "Preview" button to check out the code.
