# Image

<Featured>
  Image will handle certain optimizations for you. Such as lazy-loaded by
  default, ensuring image dimensions are reserved during page load and loading
  critical assets faster.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Image } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { ImageProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Image requires an `src` attribute which is a URL to the image. This can be either an absolute URL or an internal path depending on your build tooling.

<Example name="presentation" />

To optimize the Image for web vitals, it's required to reserve the used space and reduce layout shifts, which can be achieved in two ways.

Recommended way is to use Image with `AspectRatio` utility. It will take 100% of the parent element width and apply the height using the passed `ratio`. In this scenario, you can use the `width` prop of the AspectRatio component to set the width of the image.

<Example name="aspectRatio" />

Another way is to explicitly define both, `width` and `height` on the Image component to prevent layout shifts.

<Example name="default" />

#### `asset`

Image component is integrated with asset service, which means you can pass an `asset` object to get a url for displaying illustrations.
Illustrations rendered with this property automatically apply the correct theme color mode and adapt the image for retina screens.

<Example name="illustration" />

#### `priority`

When true, the image will be considered a high priority and load eagerly. This should only be used when an image is above the fold and deemed a critical asset. E.g. a hero image.

#### `contentMode`

Content mode by default is `fill` which covers the designated space with the image. This could sometimes lead to parts of the image being cut off. In cases where we need the entire image to be displayed, we can use the `fit` content mode.

<Example name="content Mode" />

#### `fallback`, `fallbackImage` and `fallbackIcon`

There can be a case where the `src` provided to the Image component may not exist.
Setting `fallback="image"` will render the `fallbackImage` provided.
Setting `fallback="icon"` will render the `fallbackIcon` if provided, else will default to Landscape icon.
Setting `fallback="background"` will render an empty background with the `background_alt` color.

<Example name="fallbacks" />

### Responsive Properties

Width and height properties can be responsive. That means they can have different values between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

## Accessibility

If an image provides additional context for the user, it's important to pass and `alt` text to it.
Otherwise image will be rendered with role="presentation".
