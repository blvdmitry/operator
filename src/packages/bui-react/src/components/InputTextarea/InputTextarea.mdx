## Usage

```jsx
import { InputTextarea } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { InputTextareaProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

InputTextarea renders a multi-line field with a `FormControl` wrapper that allows you to implement typical form functionality, like rendering labels, contextual message and others.
For instance, in this example we're using it with `label` and `subLabel` properties to let users understand the purpose of the field and mark it as optional.

<Example name="default" />

On the other hand, you can mark the field as required with the `required` flag.

<Example name="required" />

If you need to display an additional message suggesting user with the expected format of the field value, you can provide that with the `helper` property.

<Example name="helper" />

When using together with `large` `InputText` you can align the padding value in between both fields, with the `large` size passed to the InputTextarea as well.

<Example name="size" />

### State

In case there was an error after the form submission or you want to highlight that the field was filled in correctly, you can pass the status to the component with `error` and `success` properties.
Note that `error` supports a boolean value as well, in case you're showing an error text outside of the component.

<Example name="status" />

Interaction with the field can be `disabled`.
It can be helpful when the user has to first fill in other fields before starting to interact with the text area.

<Example name="disabled" />

Other type of user input validation is the `maximumLength` property which can be used to limit the number of characters accepted by the field.
With the `showLengthCounter` flag you can automatically show the counter for the current value length and the total length supported by the field.

<Example name="counter" />

### Controlled and uncontrolled

All input components in BUI support controlled and uncontrolled version.
Uncontrolled version is the default behavior where you can pass it a `defaultValue` and the browser will control the InputTextarea value changes.

Controlled version is enabled once you pass the `value` prop to InputTextarea.
This means that typing in the InputTextarea will trigger `onChange` but you will have to update the `value` prop using your own state.

<Example name="controlled" />

### Autogrow

You can enable the autogrow feature by providing `minVisibleLines` and `maxVisibleLines` props. When the autogrow feature is enabled the `rows` attribute will be ignored. If you only want to set a static number of visible lines you can either pass the native `rows` attribute or use `minVisibleLines` prop which are set to default `2`.

<Example name="autogrow" />

## Accessibility

- Placeholder text should be an informative message about the type of content that is expected in the textarea input.
- When using `error` as boolean, make sure to share the error message outside the field. Highlighting the error with a color is not enough for color blind users.
