## Usage

```jsx
import { Link } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { LinkProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Link component is to be used inline in the text or as a standalone element when you need an actionable element without padding.
Link comes in two variants: `primary` (default) and `secondary`.

<Example name="variants" />

Compared to Button component, Link stays aligned with the text baseline and can have a line break in the middle of its content.

<Example name="text" />

Link is dynamically inheriting the typography of its parent elements so it can be used in any context.
For example, if you wrap it with Text component, Link will inherit its size, font-weight and line-height.

Similarly, secondary links that are enclosed within a paragraph of text, get underlined.

<Example name="inheritance" />

Link supports an additional icon display on either of its sides to help the user better understand the context.

<Example name="icon" />

Link component name doesn't mean that it should be used only for rendering `<a>` html elements.
Both Link and Button have the same behaviour, and their main difference is in their design and variants.

## Accessibility

- The purpose of the link must be clear from the link text (for example, Refer friends & earn); or from the surrounding content
- In cases where you need to provide more context to the link text, use the title attribute, and add further details about the endpoint or outcome of interacting with the link
- The color of links should change based on context when used inside other components. For instance, a link in a light yellow banner component should have a color that has sufficient contrast to that background to pass a minimum AA check.
