  appear or to be downloaded.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Spinner } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { SpinnerProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

4 color values are availiable: `action` (default), `destructive`, `white` and inherit.

See example with `action` and `destructive` below:

<Example name="colors" />

Use `inherit` value if you would like the spinner to inherit the color from the parent â€” it works great with theming, dark mode and colored backgrounds; `white` at the same time will render same white-shade regardless of the theme/mode.

<Example name="whiteInherit" />

Spinner also comes in different sizes:

<Example name="sizes" />

### Responsive Properties

Size property can be responsive. That means it can have different value between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

## Accessibility

Use `ariaLabel` of the spinner with a clear exaplanation to indicate what is loaded for the user.
