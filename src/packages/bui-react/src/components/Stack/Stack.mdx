# Stack

<Featured>
  Stack is a layout utility to display multiple components grouped together,
  vertically or horizontally.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { StackProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

Stack displays multiple items and adds a gap between them, provides flexbox properties with a simplified API.

By default, it's displaying all of its children in a column.

<Example name="column" />

Stack supports gap size of any number via `gap` property.
Its value will be multiplied with the `bui_spacing_1x` value that is defined in the themes.

<Example name="gap" />

You can change Stack direction by using regular flex-direction values, like `row`, `row-reverse`, `column` and `column-reverse`.
For the row direction, Stack will also take care of the item gaps if they are displayed on multiple lines.

<Example name="row" />

### Composition

Stack includes item wrappers that provide extended flex control on the children level with a similar props API.

In some cases, Stack is applying margin directly to the children elements which might conflict with the children styles in some cases.
You can avoid that by wrapping children with `Stack.Item` component when needed.

You can stretch one or multiple items inside your Stack with `grow` flag.

<Example name="itemGrow" />

On the other hand, if you want to separate an items from the rest, you can apply `split` property to it.
It works for both row and column direction and is handy for displaying action buttons at the bottom of the cards with fixed height.

<Example name="itemSplitColumn" />

Items can be aligned separately from the rest of the group using the `alignSelf` property.

<Example name="itemAlign" />

Items wrap when they reach the maximum width by default. In some cases, such as horizontal scrolling, you might want to keep the items in a single line. In those case, you can use the `wrap` property.

<Example name="wrap" />

In some scenarios, you might need a divider between items. You can use `divided` prop for that. The dividers will be vertical in row direction.

<Example name="divided" />

### Responsive Properties

`gap`, `direction`, `alignItems`, `justifyContent`, `wrap`, `grow` and `alignSelf` properties can be responsive. That means they can have different values between viewports. You can read more about responsive properties [here](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#Responsive-development).

<Example name="responsive" />

### Utility Layer

Quite often you find yourself in need for some basic CSS styling. Stack as well as other BUI Components has support for stylying via [BUI Utility Layer](?page=Getting%2520started%252FDevelopment%252FComponents&view=documentation#BUI-Utility-Layer).

<Example name="utilityLayer" />

Try switching between breakpoints to see the styling applied and toggle "Preview" button to check out the code.

## Accessibility

- When using Stack for displaying lists of elements, don't forget to add a custom tagName for both `Stack` and `Stack.Item`
- When adding form fields and/or buttons to a group make sure to add `role="group"` to identify related form controls
