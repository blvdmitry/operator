# Toast

<Featured>
  Use toasts to give feedback to the user on an action that is not related to a
  single field. If the feedback is about a certain section on the page, consider
  using the inline variant of `alert`.

## Usage

```jsx
import { ToastProvider, useToast } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import type { ToastProps } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
```

<Example name="default" />

`Toast` component exported from the package is a simple static component that won't give you any controls over its behaviour.
In order to enable its javascript logic - you need to wrap your app with `ToastProvider`, since toasts are relying on React context.

```jsx
import { ToastProvider } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    <ToastProvider>{this.props.children}</ToastProvider>;
  }
}
```

That will give you access to the `useToast` hook which you can use to trigger toasts one by one.
Notice that only one toast stays visible on the screen and they fade-out automatically after a timeout.

```jsx
import { useToast } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";

const ToastButton = () => {
  const { show } = useToast();
  const toastProps = {
    text: "Property added to wishlist",
    action: { text: "Undo", onClick: () => console.log("Undo clicked") },
  };

  const handleClick = () => show(toastProps);

  return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Show toast</button>;
};
```

In a case when the toast's content is too long or if the action's text is long, you can use the vertical `layout` of the toast

<Example name="verticalLayout" />

## Accessibility

Users should be able to manage or limit noncritical notifications. This gives users the control to reduce the number of distractions or disruptions they receive, which is particularly helpful for users with cognitive limitations. [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.3 (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/interruptions.html). To achieve this try to reduce the toast/alert-type notificationa on the page to only be one at a time.

Some users with disabilities need more time to read or interact with messages and timed toasts may not provide sufficient time. [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.4 (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-timing.html)
For critical or emergency messages do not use toast, use the Alert component instead.
