# Major releases

We're using semver 2.0 to control our breaking changes and are aiming to release not more than 2 major releases per year.
In reality that turns into a major release every 7-8 months according to our past experience.

Major releases are batches of changes focused on specific topic that are changing some aspect of the library publicly exposed parts.
Every major release starts with an RFC shared with a community in advance.
It explains the proposed changes, how they will affect the product and their technical implementation.

As a matter of library support - we provide full support for the latest major version release as well as critical fixes for the previous major version.

### Migration guidelines

After the release is published, we provide a migration guideline from the previous version for a smoother product adoption.
