# Tech radar

## Technologies we're following

- We're looking at the vanilla CSS spec improvements to see which of the features we might adopt in the future:
  - CSS module scripts can be used as a native way to import css files from within JS while keeping tree-shaking: https://web.dev/css-module-scripts/
  - Native support for custom media queries to remove PostCSS plugin responsible for that: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/mediaqueries-5/Overview.bs#L2577
  - CSS logical properties to provide RTL styles for components without code duplication: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties
- CSS solution we're currently using serves us well and is great in terms of performance and learning curve. However, since it's close to vanilla CSS - all the syntax errors happening in CSS are not reflected or logged anywhere.
  There is a good opportunity to improve that experience by looking into the libraries like `vanilla-extract` that keep the output of the library as CSS files but provides TS type checking during the development phase.
- We have no solution for handling JS operated animations. Once we start focusing more on the UI motion as a part of the library and there will be an opportunity to improve the same DX for the product teams.
  We'll be able to explore a way to handle it with libraries like `framer-motion`.

## Currently adopted technologies

**Peer dependencies:**

We expect 3 dependencies to be available on the product side to provide compatibility with the product code.

- `React` is used as our underlying UI framework as a technology adopted across the company for the front-end development.
- `Typescript` is an optional peer dependency that can be used on the product, however this means that we're providing automatically generated types for all of our code.
- `PostCSS` is our way to handle CSS functionality not yet supported by the browsers we develop for. For example, it provides access to custom media queries provided by BUI React, which is a feature that is not yet available in the browsers natively.
- `CSS modules` as a way to avoid CSS naming conflicts across the product. Usually provided by the build tools like Webpack and is not installed separately.

**Development dependencies:**

- `Foundry` for writing and publishing components documentation for the product teams.
- `Jest, React testing library, Cypress` is our toolset for writing tests to make sure we cover both unit and screenshot testing and provide full codebase coverage.
- `Eslint, stylelint, prettier` are used for automated code linting and formatting to avoid unnesessary discussions around the code style.
- `Lerna` as a tool to manage BUI related packages, run scripts across all of them and provide a unified release process.
- `Husky` is used for automated git hooks to lint and test code before pushing the code to the repository
- `Webpack` for building .js and .css bundles in addition to the ESM build provided by the library.
