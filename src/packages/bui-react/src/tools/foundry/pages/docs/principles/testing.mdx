# Testing

## Manual testing

For manual testing we use Foundry and we store `.foundry.tsx` file in the components `tests` folder.
For each component we're providing:

- A playground with properties controls
- A set of component examples
- Markdown documentation that's using the provided examples.

**Running Foundry:**

To run the Foundry instance locally run `yarn react:start` script.

### Unit testing

For unit testing we're using Jest + React testing library.

- Unit tests should not only test how its content is rendered but also event handlers calls, its interactive behaviour and how accessibility attributes are applied.
- We don't use snapshot testing for components. Instead we write assertions manually and for everything visual - we use visual regression tests.

**Running unit tests:**

All unit tests are executed in CI and on commit, but you can also run them yourself with `yarn react:test:unit`.

### VRT

For visual regression testing we are relying on `@bookingcom/bui-env` package.
Read more about it in the [package documentation](https://gitlab.booking.com/design-systems/bui/bui-web/-/tree/bui@current/packages/bui-env).
