# Using foundations

All BUI foundations are available in the product in a form of theme objects coming from `BUIProvider` wrapper.

```jsx
import { BUIProvider } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import LegacyTheme from "@bookingcom/bui-react/themes/legacy";

const App = () => (
  <BUIProvider theme={LegacyTheme}>Your application code</BUIProvider>
);
```

It gives you access to all variables, mixins and media queries defined in the current theme for both, CSS and JS.

## Changing the appearance

Besides defining the global theme, there are two other things you have control over: theme modes and scoped theming.

Theme mode is a switch between light and dark mode of every theme.
It's defined once per application and gets inherited by all themes used in the code.
To control it - you should use `defaultThemeMode` property of BUIProvider and `useThemeMode` hook.

```jsx
import { useThemeMode, BUIProvider, Button } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import LegacyTheme from "@bookingcom/bui-react/themes/legacy";

const App = () => (
  <BUIProvider defaultThemeMode="dark" theme={LegacyTheme}>
    <Component />
  </BUIProvider>
);

const Component = () => {
  const { invertMode } = useThemeMode();

  return <Button onClick={invertMode} text="Invert theme mode" />;
};
```

Scoped theming is a way to change the theme values for a specific part of the page.

```jsx
import { BUIProvider } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";
import ProductCard from "components/ProductCard";
import LegacyTheme from "@bookingcom/bui-react/themes/legacy";
import TravellerTheme from "@bookingcom/bui-react/themes/traveller";

const App = () => (
  <BUIProvider theme={LegacyTheme}>
    <ProductCard />

    <TravellerTheme>
      <ProductCard />
    </TravellerTheme>
  </BUIProvider>
);
```

## Using variables

We're using CSS custom properties in runtime, so all variables become available once the theme is used.
Through variables, you can get access to colors and units:

```
.foo {
  color: var(--bui_color_foreground);
  padding: var(--bui_spacing_4x);
  border-radius: var(--bui_border_radius_100);
  border: var(--bui_border_width_100) solid var(--bui_color_border);
}
```

## Using typography

Typography from foundations is provided with the `Text` component which will take care of its variants, colors and responsiveness.
You can find more information about it in the component menu.

Typography design documentation: https://design.booking.com/article/bui/foundations/typography/

## Using iconography

We have an asset service available at https://asset-service.booking.com that represents all icons available for use.
The easiest way to start using them is to install `@bookingcom/bui-assets-react` to import assets directly into your application as React components.

In case if you find any icon missing in the list, you can contribute to the asset service repository following the guidelines: https://design.booking.com/article/bui/foundations/iconography/

## Using foundations in JS

All the same variables are available in JS by using the `useTheme` hook.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from "@bookingcom/bui-react";

const Foo = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return <div style={{ color: theme.colors.foreground }} />;
};
```
